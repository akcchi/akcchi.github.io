                Do I even need to explain? The prequels were absolute masterclasses in cinema, easily eclipsing the original trilogy. 
                From introducing the fan-favourite character Jar Jar Binks (TPM),

                and showcasing the tragic downfall of Anakin Skywalker and the Jedi Order (ROTS) - 
                an intricately crafted story from start to end with totally no faults. 
                Closing with a shot of the Tatooine twin suns (ROTS), 
                the prequel trilogy beautifully and consistently ties in with the original trilogy - what more could fans have asked for?

                Pretty self explanatory. Where to even begin? Honestly, Shrek terrified me as a child. 
                But as one grows older one learns that Shrek is love, and Shrek is indeed life. 
                Shrek is timeless - in fact, there have been
